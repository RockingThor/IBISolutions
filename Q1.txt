            using the browser. In most of the cases maximum amount of cookies stored by a specific 
            domain is limited to 4kB. The data stored in the cookie can be shared across the various
            websites. Also cookie storage easy to access s it is a concern when it comes to security.

                    is not sent over every request. The data stored in the local storage stays intact till 
                    the time it is deleted by the user or the browser.
