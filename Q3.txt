Q3. What is Sharding in MongoDB, and how does it work?

Answer=>    Distributing data across multiple machine in a mongoDB cluster is called shrading. This method
            helps user to scale his DB horizontally so that the DB can handle more traffic or can hold more
            data when the time comes.

Work Procedure =>   First of all I have to create a sharded cluster by adding one or more shards in my cluster.
                    Then, I have to shard a collection by mentioning the shard key. Mongodb will automatically 
                    distribute the data chunks in the collection across my cluster. When any CRUD operation will
                    be performed it will be automatically update shard key and distribute the document to the 
                    appropiate shard. When I query anything it will query the appropiate shard and will bring me 
                    the result.
